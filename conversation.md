Here is an example version of the app.py module with a basic "Hello, World!" print statement inside the if __name__ == "__main__" block:

```python
# app.py

def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this version of the module, the main function simply prints "Hello, World!" to the console. When the script is run directly (as the main program), the main function is called and the message is printed.

You can copy and paste this code into your app.py file in Repl.it, ensure that the file is saved, and then run the script to see the "Hello, World!" message displayed in the console. If you encounter any issues or have specific requirements for the module, feel free to let me know so I can assist you further.
